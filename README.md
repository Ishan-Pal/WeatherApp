This ensures that the website adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout and styling elements are carefully crafted using CSS, creating a clean and modern aesthetic.

Additionally, the WeatherApp website offers personalized features through user accounts. Users can sign up and create profiles to receive customized weather notifications based on their preferred locations and weather preferences. JavaScript handles the account management functionalities, such as user authentication, storing user preferences, and delivering notifications.

In summary, the WeatherApp website combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an immersive, responsive, and interactive weather experience.
